This is an Arch package that builds mongodb 3.2.22 core binaries for
armv7l aka armhf aka a Raspberry Pi 4.  It is the bare minimum hack job to
get binaries installed so that I can run the Ubiquiti Unifi controller.
I don't know how to make arch packages.  I don't know anything about
mongodb.  Use this package only if you are on an equally desperate
mission.

Building on the Raspberry Pi will take about 10-12 hours and consume
8-10GB of disk space.

If you want to go full YOLO then already-built binaries may exist at
https://github.com/mdickers47/mongodb-pkg/releases.
